Hi all,

  Welcome to BMB-Services's Github.

  Here you will find documentation based on https://open.sap.com.
  Their documentations are nice, and their speakers too !

  The file tree is managed like that :
   - Explication contains tutoriel & questions who was asked by myself during the course
   - Source code, contains workings examples

  I recommand to follow the course on https://open.sap.com

  I will build this documentation for french users.
