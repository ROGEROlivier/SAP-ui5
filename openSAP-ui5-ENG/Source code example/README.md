# openSAP-ui5-course

This repository contains related material for the openSAP course "Developing Web Apps with SAPUI5" (https://open.sap.com/courses/ui51). 
The free course will start at 24th of May 2016 and you can enroll using the link above.

Why isn't all course material published yet?
--------------------------------------------

Right now, the course is in the middle of week 3. So there is the mockdata for the service and the solutions for the first three week's exercises published.

We will publish the solution exercises fore each course week once it has been unlocked on the openSAP platform. **Next repository update will be on 14th of June 2016 with the solutions for week 4.**

You can find all solution exercises in this public repository as the course advances. Later on, when the course will be in archive mode you can browse all exercises here and branch them for your needs.

What's in here?
-----------------

In the master branch you can find:
* A folder with mock data for running the application project without a backend service connection
* Solutions to all the course exercises (each unit in a separate folder: w3u4 = week 3 unit 4)
* Find more details in the corresponsing README.md file: https://github.com/SAP/openSAP-ui5-course/blob/master/README.md
